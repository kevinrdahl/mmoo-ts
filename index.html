<p>Hell, this version doesn't even do anything. <em>We'll get there.</em></p>

<a id="what-is-mmo-online" class="anchor" href="#what-is-mmo-online" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is MMO Online?</h2>

<p>This is an attempt to create a game world that is not only worth playing in, but fun to play in. Games don't need to be obtuse to be deep, and they don't need to be dumbed down to be accessible. The game's design is informed by simple notions that people making MMOs seem to forget.</p>

<h4>
<a id="actions-have-obvious-consequences" class="anchor" href="#actions-have-obvious-consequences" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Actions have obvious consequences.</h4>

<p>If your actions don't have any meaning, why do anything? If you put something somewhere, it should be there, and if you take something away, it should be gone. If you see a tree felled somewhere, it means someone cut it down. If you set fire to someone's house, that house will be gone. You monster.</p>

<h4>
<a id="everything-comes-from-somewhere" class="anchor" href="#everything-comes-from-somewhere" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Everything comes from somewhere.</h4>

<p>Most MMOs have systems which exist outside the game world and bring things into it. For instance, finish a dungeon and spin a wheel to get a random item; complete an achievement and get a silly hat; spend real money to get a cool sword. These systems give a cheap thrill to the player, but serve to devalue more organic means of acquiring things. What's more, they don't bring anything to the game that couldn't have been there anyway.</p>

<h4>
<a id="characters-exist-in-only-one-world" class="anchor" href="#characters-exist-in-only-one-world" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Characters exist in only one world.</h4>

<p>This is twofold: you only see one world, and everything in your world is native to it. If two people go to the same place, they will see each other. If someone steals from you, you can hunt them down. Many MMOs let you play with people you will likely never meet again, often disabling many forms of interaction such as trade. This leads to interactions with little depth and no consequence.</p>

<h4>
<a id="dont-reinvent-the-wheel" class="anchor" href="#dont-reinvent-the-wheel" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't reinvent the wheel.</h4>

<p>Want to tackle a solved problem? <em>Use the solution</em>. No one ever opened their inventory hoping for a new, unique take on item management. There is a place for reinvention, and basic functions aren't it.</p>

<h4>
<a id="any-type-of-character-should-be-possible" class="anchor" href="#any-type-of-character-should-be-possible" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Any type of character should be possible.</h4>

<p>Players' ideal characters might not be obvious, or even sensible, but they should be allowed to make them anyway. If they want to gear up in chain mail pants, leather gloves, a horse-plumed helmet and a magic wand, they should be able to. It will suck, but they will have <em>chosen</em> to suck, and it will feel <em>great</em>. Some games let you combine two archetypes and say "wow, you can make <em>aaaaanything</em>!". Many things isn't anything. Don't lie to me.</p>

<p>It's meant to be. I don't want to type up loads of details that I won't get done for a long time. I'm not some kind of ideas guy.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<a id="what-makes-this-special" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-this-special" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What makes this special?</h2>

<p>A lot of MMOs start out doing everything right, and then do something monumentally stupid. Maybe it's for money. Maybe they don't understand the genre of game they're trying to create. Maybe they hate us. MMO Online is a passion project, not tempered by economical ambition, poorly researched demographics, or reckless hate. I already have an income, my target demographic is myself, and I love everyone. I'm going to make a thing that I want to exist, because I can.</p>

<a id="can-you-do-this" class="anchor" href="#can-you-do-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can you do this?</h2>

<p>Sure. Honestly, any competent developer can make an MMO. It just takes a long time.</p>

<p>Probably not (yet). But thanks for asking, it means a lot.</p>
