<p>Hell, this version doesn't even do anything. <em>We'll get there.</em></p>

<a id="what-is-mmo-online" class="anchor" href="#what-is-mmo-online" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is MMO Online?</h2>

<p>This is an attempt to create a game world that is not only worth playing in, but fun to play in. Games don't need to be obtuse to be deep, and they don't need to be dumbed down to be accessible. The game's design is informed by simple notions that people making MMOs seem to forget.</p>

<h4>
<a id="idea1" class="anchor" href="#idea1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Players' actions should should affect the world around them in a way that makes sense and has meaning.</h4>

<p>If you put something somewhere, it should be there, and if you take something away, it should be gone. It's such an integral part of everyday life that designers always seem to neglect. Why bother doing something with no consequence?</p>

<h4>
<a id="idea2" class="anchor" href="#idea2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Everything should come from somewhere.</h4>

<p>In many games, players acquire items from systems which are outside of the game world. For instance, complete a dungeon and spin a wheel to receive an item. This takes you out of the world, by adding something with no logical reason to be there. Solution: don't do this! Find more interesting ways to give things to players.</p>

<h4>
<a id="characters-should-exist-in-one-world-and-one-world-only" class="anchor" href="#characters-should-exist-in-one-world-and-one-world-only" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Characters should exist in one world, and one world only.</h4>

<p>Do you think I care about the guy who just faded into existence with a star after his name? No, I don't. Because he's not a part of my world, and he'll be gone in a minute. He doesn't exist. Can there be multiple worlds? Sure, but they should each be their own, self-contained system.</p>

<h4>
<a id="present-options-in-ways-people-will-understand" class="anchor" href="#present-options-in-ways-people-will-understand" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Present options in ways people will understand.</h4>

<p>Everyone thinks they're so clever, reinventing the wheel for basic systems. Want to tackle a solved problem? <em>Use the solution</em>. No one ever opened their inventory hoping for a new, unique take on storing objects.</p>

<h4>
<a id="any-type-of-character-should-be-possible" class="anchor" href="#any-type-of-character-should-be-possible" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Any type of character should be possible.</h4>

<p>Players' ideal characters might not be obvious, or even sensible, but they should be allowed to make them anyway. If they want to gear up in chain mail pants, leather gloves, a horse-plumed helmet and a magic wand, they should be able to. It will suck, but they will have <em>chosen</em> to suck, and it will feel <em>great</em>. Some games let you combine two archetypes and say "wow, you can make <em>aaaaanything</em>!". Many things isn't anything. This is basic math.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>A lot of MMOs start out doing everything right, and then do something monumentally stupid. Maybe it's for money. Maybe they don't understand the genre of game they're trying to create. Maybe they hate us. MMO Online is a passion project, not tempered by economical ambition, poorly researched demographics, or reckless hate. I already have an income, my target demographic is myself, and I love everyone. I'm going to make a thing that I want to exist, because I can.</p>

<p>Sure. Honestly, any competent developer can make an MMO. It just takes a long time.</p>

<p>Probably not (yet). But thanks for asking, it means a lot.</p>
