Games don't need to be obtuse to be deep, and they don't need to be dumbed down to be accessible. The game's design is informed by simple notions that people making MMOs seem to forget.\r\n\r\n#### Actions have obvious consequences.\r\nIf your actions don't have any meaning, why do anything? If you put something somewhere, it should be there, and if you take something away, it should be gone. If you see a tree felled somewhere, it means someone cut it down. If you set fire to someone's house, that house will be gone. You monster.\r\n\r\n#### Everything comes from somewhere.\r\nMost MMOs have systems which exist outside the game world and bring things into it. For instance, finish a dungeon and spin a wheel to get a random item; complete an achievement and get a silly hat; spend real money to get a cool sword. These systems give a cheap thrill to the player, but serve to devalue more organic means of acquiring things. What's more, they don't bring anything to the game that couldn't have been there anyway.\r\n\r\n#### Characters exist in only one world.\r\nThis is twofold: you only see one world, and everything in your world is native to it. If two people go to the same place, they will see each other. If someone steals from you, you can hunt them down. Many MMOs let you play with people you will likely never meet again, often disabling many forms of interaction such as trade. This leads to interactions with little depth and no consequence.\r\n\r\n#### Don't reinvent the wheel.\r\nWant to tackle a solved problem? _Use the solution_. No one ever opened their inventory hoping for a new, unique take on item management. There is a place for reinvention, and basic functions aren't it.\r\n\r\n#### Any type of character should be possible.\r\nPlayers' ideal characters might not be obvious, or even sensible, but they should be allowed to make them anyway. If they want to gear up in chain mail pants, leather gloves, a horse-plumed helmet and a magic wand, they should be able to. It will suck, but they will have _chosen_ to suck, and it will feel _great_. Some games let you combine two archetypes and say \"wow, you can make _aaaaanything_!\". Many things isn't anything. Don't lie to me.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Gee, this all sounds pretty vague.\r\nIt's meant to be. I don't want to type up loads of details that I won't get done for a long time. I'm not some kind of ideas guy.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Will this make MMOs great again?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## What makes this special?\r\nA lot of MMOs start out doing everything right, and then do something monumentally stupid. Maybe it's for money. Maybe they don't understand the genre of game they're trying to create. Maybe they hate us. MMO Online is a passion project, not tempered by economical ambition, poorly researched demographics, or reckless hate. I already have an income, my target demographic is myself, and I love everyone. I'm going to make a thing that I want to exist, because I can.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Can you do this?\r\nSure. Honestly, any competent developer can make an MMO. It just takes a long time.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Can I help?\r\nProbably not (yet). But thanks for asking, it means a lot.\r\n",
